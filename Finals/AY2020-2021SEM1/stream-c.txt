The answer would not be correct at all. This is because parallel() will fork the stream into two threads, the main thread and a commonPool thread. Each thread will start off from 0 to n - t, where t is the last calculated value of the previous thread. For example, the stream could calculate the sum of 0 to 56 and 0 to 44 and add them together instead of 0 to 100 in a single thread. This leads to inconsistent results, as forEachOrdered is not used.
