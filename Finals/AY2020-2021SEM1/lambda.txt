bar() does not compile. This is because x is a local variable while y is a static variable and the local variable has to be effectively final or else it will result in a compile time error. This is because lambdas captures the variable x by making a copy of it, thus having the ability to alter the variable x on the next line will mean that the Runnable r1 will not be updated, leading to bugs. For static y, since its in the heap memeory, the compiler can guarantee that the lambda will have access to the latest value of y, and thus r2 is updated accordingly.
